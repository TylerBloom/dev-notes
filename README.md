## About
This is an (Obsidian)[https://obsidian.md/] vault that holds my notes as a developer. Ideas contained here largely inspired by my side projects (such as (Squire)[https://github.com/MonarchDevelopment/SquireCore]) and general open-source work. While these ideas might reference specific problems and designs that I encounter as context, they will be discussed in the abstract here.

I'm not in the business of gatekeeping information. So, since these notes are part of my blog-writing process, I want to make them public so that folks can have access to the ideas in full and just what I can fit into an article.
