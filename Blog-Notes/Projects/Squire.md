# About
Squire is my longest running project. Squire is tournament software for running Magic: the Gathering tournaments and designed to allow for maximum flexibility for tournament organizers.

Originally a Discord bot written in Python, this project sparked my learning of Rust after the Discord API library it used was deprecated. The bot was rewritten in Rust and then generalized into a full webservice. It has been a tremendous learning opportunity for me and many others.

Squire uses full stack Rust, with Axum in the backend and Yew in the frontend. Work on mobile apps has recently started with a planned stack of Yew and Tauri. A similar stack will be used for the native desktop app.
