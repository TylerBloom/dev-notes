# About
Specter is my newest project and is still in the very early phases of development. Specter is my attempt as emulators of Nintendo handhelds (particularly the GameBoy series). My plan for Specter is to provide an interconnected service for syncing save data and to act as a personal repository of ROMs.

Like everything I write, this project will be pure Rust, with a WASM web frontend, native Rust desktop and mobile apps, and even a handheld. The current plans for the handheld is to use a Raspberry Pi as the core and work from there; however, other chip options are being considered.
