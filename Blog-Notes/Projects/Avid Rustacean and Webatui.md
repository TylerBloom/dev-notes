# About
This blog is one of my newest projects. After publishing this blog, I split off all of the rendering logic into a separate crate called Webatui, which contains the integration between Ratatui and Yew. 

Currently, Webatui only supports rendering text in order to emulate a terminal aesthetic. There are tentative plans to expand this, but to what extent is unclear.

You can find a link to this blog's repo in the footer, and you can find the Webatui repo [here](https://github.com/TylerBloom/webatui).
