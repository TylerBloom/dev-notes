## TL;DR
Like most things that I write anymore, this blog is pure Rust, frontend and backend. The backend isn't anything super special: [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) + [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and deployed on [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/). All great pieces of technology and every easy to use. All of the interesting things are in the frontend, where I combine several things that are not meant to be be combined. The UI is a WASM module that combines [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) for TUI-based text renderings and [Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew) for general application scaffolding and browser interactivity.

## Backend Basics
When I say that the backend is basic, I do not mean that stack is basic. You can build amazing things with any single piece of the stack. Axum in particular is incredible and my favorite server framework in the Rust ecosystem. Rather, the backend is basic because its main job is to serve pre-parsed markdown documents. I discuss what I mean by "pre-parsed" a bit later on.

## The Vision
I have long wanted to put together a developer blog (about as long as I've been using Rust) but inspiration for its design had never stuck me...  until it did. I think it clear what I'm going for... its a TUI. I use (neo)vim and i3, greatly enjoy the text-based aesthetic, and practically live in the terminal. Once I had the idea, I couldn't let it go. 

Great, so this will be easy! I **only** need to pull blog post data from the backend, parse it, and display it as HTML! There are libraries to do all of that...

Great, but how much did I want to stick with other aspects of the terminal? While I would have been more than happy naviating the blog with just HJKL and/or arrow keys, mobile users would have other things to say. And what about the content itself? 

And, as is my want, it needed to be a full-stack Rust app. I was already comfortable with [[Yew]] for webapp UIs, so I just needed a w


Pull data in some format from the backend, parse it, and display

## The UI Stack
And there are libraries for those things: parsing "data", rendering text displays, rendering to HTML, and interacting with the browser. In fact, I already knew crates that did all of those things. Ratatui is a great, high-level crate for rendering text displays, and I've used Yew quite a lot, which is 3 of the 4 requirements. It was just a matter of gluing them together.

At a high level, these align fairly well. Ratatui provides a series of high-level widgets that can borrow strings for the renderings. These widgets are then rendered into an internal buffer and past onto a terminal "backend" to be displayed to the user. In the Yew model, this all happens in the rendering/view step. Once created, a Yew component can receive messages that update the component's state. The component can then communicate that the UI needs to be re-rendered.

The rendering step is where almost all of the bridging between the libraries occurs. Up until that point, this means the webapp can go about doing normal webapp things: setting everything up, fetching data from the backend, and processing that data as needed.

## All about Yew
As stated before, Yew components are updated through messages passing, but where do they get these messages? They can come from lots of sources, but most of the time, they are generated by callbacks that are called when a window event happens.

Linking callbacks to window events works in a similar way to how you would do things in JS. That's because, under the hood, you are doing things in JS. You can link a callback to a window event using the [web_sys](https://crates.io/crates/web-sys) crate. This manages the dirty work of communicating with the JS runtime and keeps you on the Rust side of the language barrier. While the API is far from ergonomic, it is easy to use once you get used to it, and it opens the door wide open to capturing interactions with the browser. Some interactivity, such as capturing window resize and scroll events, has to be done directly through `web_sys`, but...

Yew directly provides support for registering event to specific HTML elements. Often, this is done through their `html!`, which lets you embed HTML snippets into your Rust code. This provides an extremely easy to use API and is useful if, for example, you have an element that you want to provide on-click interactivity to.

With just Yew, I was able to get most of the way a functional blog. If I wanted a more traditional blog, I could have used it to get me the rest of the way.

## Webatui
To say that the browser is not a normal terminal is an understatement. Nevertheless, Ratatui provided just enough flexibility via their `Backend` trait to make it work. Conceptually, a terminal is *just* a grid of characters with each character potentially having its own formatting, and that's pretty easy to emulate.

Of course, an actual terminal is substantially more complicated, but we aren't working with a terminal. We're working with a browser. While browsers are even more complex; their mode of rendering UIs isn't because of ASCII escape codes used on teletype machines. With the tools provided by Yew, rendering a grid of characters to HTML will be fairly simple.

As a frame is being rendered, the "terminal" backend will populate its grid of characters. When the frame is done being drawn, the Ratatui `Terminal` will call the `flush` method on the terminal backend. This is where the HTML will be rendered.

The terminal backend has a row of characters for each line that can be rendered in the window. Each row gets rendered as a series of HTML `<span>` tags. The terminal backend scans a row and creates a span for each consecutive group of characters with identical formatting. These spans then get wrapped in a `<pre></pre>` tag. 

And with that, the terminal backend is done. The app can then copy this rendered HTML and pass it to Yew which will, in turn, display it. Ratatui and Yew and now talk to each other!

## The First Snag
Yes, the TUI and UI library can communicate, but only in simple terms. At this point, the only type of navigation that's possible is with the keyboard. While I would be happy to use HJKL and/or arrow keys to navigate, mobile users would be less than happy. So, how to support click interactivity?

With `web_sys`, we are about to get all mouse events, including movement, clicking, and more. We could do something really hacky like calculate what character in the grid was clicked on and then leave the app to determine what that character means. For obvious reason, this seemed like it would be prone to lots of errors and extremely cumbersome to work with. Besides, Yew provides a way to embed callbacks, it would be great if we could *just* use that.

Unfortunately (but reasonably), Ratatui doesn't support such a thing. We can sort of link state to a widgets (if it are a `StatefulWidget`), but this is more intended for internal calculation for the widget. No information about what widget is being draw or any linked data is passed to the backend.

In fact, the backend **only** has access to text and formatting data, so what if we use part of this formatting data as a flag that a span of text needs additional data? There are several formatting modifiers that I did not plan to support. If the terminal backend cannibalized one of them to mean "needs to be hydrated with data", then we can already detect this during the grid-to-spans parsing process. Once the spans are parsed out, a step can be added to provide the app an opportunity to hydrate pieces of text with data before being rendered into HTML.

In the updated flow, flushing the terminal backend just parses the character grid into plain and dehydrated spans and no HTML is rendered. To get the HTML, the terminal backend provides a `hydrate` method which takes a closure that will hydrate dehydrated spans with hyperlinks and on-click callbacks (and eventually more). The spans are then rendered into HTML, which is cached and a copy is given to the caller. The process of displaying this HTML is still the same.

## Bells and Whistles
With this new two-step rendering process in the terminal backend, interactivity abounds. You can switch blog tabs with your mouse or on your phone, you can load posts and projects by clicking their summaries, and links be embedded in writes and in the blog's footer. 

But there's more. When the window is resized, the terminal backend adjusts its grid of characters to fit the new screen and everything is re-rendered. The page scrolling is captured and used to move the in-terminal scrollbar (because it looks nicer than the browser's scroll bar). And, of course, arrow key-based movement persists. I have plans for more vim-like movements in the future, so, for now, a mouse will have to suffice.

## Page Data
There's one thing that I have yet to discuss, what format is used for the data that's used to display posts like the one that you're reading? I read these in markdown (in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)), so I wanted to be able to parse this markdown as well as any Rust code blocks and transform them into text rendering on all in the frontend.

For technical reasons (the syntax highlighting crate wouldn't compile to WASM), I could not perform all of that directly in the frontend. This was probably for the best as it reduced the final WASM module size. Still, I could not do all of the rendering on the backend. The frontend still needs to know how to format certain piece of text. How else would **bold** , *italicized*, and _underscored_ text be presented? More importantly, how could I provide syntax highlighting?!

Ultimately, the backend adopted the responsibility of parsing markdown pages into a markdown AST. For this, the backend uses the [markdown-rs](https://github.com/wooorm/markdown-rs) crate. Less than half of the full feature set is applicable to this project, so it provides the data in a minimal format, just enough for the frontend to render into text and nothing more.

For syntax highlighting, the backend uses the [syntect](https://github.com/trishume/syntect) crate. Now... I did not have a good experience with this crate. Just getting it to work was a larger headache that piecing together the entire Yew + Ratatui communication and render process. Still, its clear that the crate is well built (probably why its so widely used), and that my usecase is fairly far-afield from their standard usecase (I wanted only one syntax, Rust, and one non-default theme). But once I got it working, it plugged seamlessly into the parsing process with the markdown parser.

## Conclusion
Building the blog has been one of the most fun projects that I've done in a while. It required a good amount of engineering and tinkering, but I ran into relatively few large roadblocks. I can't wait to continue to share things on this blog, including the flag education series: Rust from First Principles.

If you are interested in the code base, you can find the repo for this project linked in the footer. If you are interested in using the "web terminal" backend, reach out. I'm considering making it in own crate.

Well, its been a pleasure. Same time next time?


# Write Up

## TL;DR
As is my want, this blog is a fullstack Rust project. The backend is very straightforward as its job is largely to serve documents for posts. Its stack is fair straightforward: Axum + MongoDB and deployed on Shuttle. All of the unique parts of the project are in the frontend. There, I combine Ratatui and Yew for a texted-based UI. This presented a series of interesting challenges.

## The Vision
I've wanted to build a developer blog every since learning Rust about 2 years ago. My goal is to provide a platform where I can talk about different Rust educational topics, the project that I'm working on (all of which are in Rust), and to discuss things that I've learned as a dev.

These are fairly basic requirements, so the door is wide open in terms of design. While this sounds great, the lack of constraint made it hard to envision what I wanted for a long time. That was until inspiration struck me: a TUI!

I use (neo)vim and i3, greatly enjoy the text-based aesthetic, and practically live in the terminal. So when I thought of this, I couldn't stop. Over the course of building the very blog that you are using, I ran into several interesting problems, particular around getting [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) to work in the browser with [Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew).

## Backend Basics
Before we can discuss the interesting pieces in the frontend, we first need a way to serve the data that the frontend will be displaying. Luckily, this is a blog, so nothing too complicated is needed. In fact, the backend largely holds page data in the form of markdown documents that are parsed and served to the frontend. So, a series of basic CRUD APIs is all that it really needs.

Other than being a repository of page documents, the backend has one other crucial role: pre-parse the markdown and any code blocks contained within. I wanted to do that in the frontend, but for technical reasons (the syntax highlighting crate wouldn't compile to WASM), that plan fell through. So, what does this pre-parsing entail?

The [markdown-rs](https://github.com/wooorm/markdown-rs) is used to parse out the page's AST. Now, due to do my needs and the limitations of a text-based UI, over half of the markdown spec is not needed. As such, the backend stores and serves a custom, minimal subset of the AST. Just enough to meet my needs and nothing more. Inside of markdown can be code blocks. I would very much like to provide syntax highlighting for them. For syntax highlighting, the backend using the [syntect](https://github.com/trishume/syntect) crate.

And that's basically all of the duties of the backend. Simple yet powerful enough to get the ball rolling.

## The UI Stack
The flow for the UI is also fairly simple: load in, fetch some data from the backend, render that data into text, and display an HTML translation of that text. I had knowledge about crates that could help with all of this, so the stack built itself.

I've used Yew extensively for other projects and is a fairly pleasant library to work with. To provides a framework for building application components, rendering HTML that is displayed, and much more.

I had never used Ratatui, but I had heard good things (which it lived up to). It is a relatively high-level library that provides widgets that can be rendered and drawn onto a canvas of text. The "canvas" is the [Terminal](https://docs.rs/ratatui/0.24.0/ratatui/struct.Terminal.html), which is generic over a type that implements their [Backend](https://docs.rs/ratatui/0.24.0/ratatui/backend/trait.Backend.html) trait. This was obviously meant to interface with actual terminals, but there isn't much that isn't applicable to the browser, and, more importantly, there isn't anything that makes it difficult/impossible to work in the browser.

At this point, everything seems feasible. Now, time to investigate how well they integrate.

## All About Yew
Yew is a reactive, Elm-inspired framework. It models pieces of the UI using its [Component](https://docs.rs/yew/latest/yew/html/trait.Component.html). 

As stated before, Yew components are updated through messages passing, but where do they get these messages? They can come from lots of sources, but most of the time, they are generated by callbacks that are called when a window event happens.

Linking callbacks to window events works in a similar way to how you would do things in JS. That's because, under the hood, you are doing things in JS. You can link a callback to a window event using the [web_sys](https://crates.io/crates/web-sys) crate. This manages the dirty work of communicating with the JS runtime and keeps you on the Rust side of the language barrier. While the API is far from ergonomic, it is easy to use once you get used to it, and it opens the door wide open to capturing interactions with the browser. Some interactivity, such as capturing window resize and scroll events, has to be done directly through `web_sys`, but...

Yew directly provides support for registering event to specific HTML elements. Often, this is done through their `html!`, which lets you embed HTML snippets into your Rust code. This provides an extremely easy to use API and is useful if, for example, you have an element that you want to provide on-click interactivity to.

With just Yew, I was able to get most of the way a functional blog. If I wanted a more traditional blog, I could have used it to get me the rest of the way.
