# About
"Rust from First Principles" is the flagship blog series of [[The Avid Rustacean]]. The primary idea of this series is to flesh out and give examples for my Rust educational philosophies:
 - Rust (and its ecosystem) are a wholly learnable language.
 - "You can understand 80+% of what you need to know about an API from its function signature and a loose mental model"
 - A mastery over the rules of Rust give you the tools to become an expert in the language and ecosystem.
 - A focus on the function signature makes for more cohesive APIs and makes documenting those APIs easier

These topics and my thoughts around the learning curve are covered in the intro to the series.
